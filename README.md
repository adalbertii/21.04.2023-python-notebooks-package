The repository contains Jupyter notebooks:

1. wmi_flask_ngrok.ipynb : notebook presenting building website using the Flask framework. Public access to the service is provided through the Ngrok platform

2. wmi_keras_classification_case.ipynb : notebook discussing the construction and training of a classification model intended for inferring whether a patient will develop diabetes

3. wmi_keras_classification_iris_case.ipynb : notebook presenting the process of building and training the classification model and the investment of the implementation package, which will be used to build the REST service (issue number 1)

4. wmi_keras_classification_iris_rest_api.ipynb - describing discussing the construction of a REST service using a trained classification model

5. wmi_keras_digit_recognition_case.ipynb - notebook presenting the process of building a neural network dedicated to recognizing handwritten numbers

6. wmi_keras_linear_regression_one_neuron_case.ipynb - he simplest case of a neural network built from a single neuran. The model can perform linear regression of the data

7. wmi_openAI_client.ipynb - an example of an implementation of the client layer of the REST service hosted by the Open AI service

8. wmi_pytorch_regression_case.ipynb - case of a neural network performing regressive estimation of housing prices

9. wmi_keras_convolutional_case.ipynb - an example of an implementation of convolutional network. The model can perform binary classification.

10. wmi_keras_classification_diabets_case_case.ipynb - diabetes risk assessment network. By performing binary classification.
